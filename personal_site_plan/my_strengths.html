                        <h2> My Strengths </h2>
                        <p id="firstParagraph"> According to the High 5 Test, I am a:  Time Keeper. Your objective is to set timelines and deadlines. Surprises annoy you, so you prefer to plan everything. You donâ€™t necessarily need full control, but there must be order and predictability in the world around you. You unconsciously impose structure into everything by setting up routines, timelines, and deadlines. If you make plans, you follow them thoroughly, no matter what. In a team or project environment, your need for structure and discipline are extremely valuable in maintaining progress and productivity.

                        <h2>I Agree with my strengths. In my current job role, I was asked to create a Scheduling Committee. I was to write out the Charter and Bylaws.  It was also imperative that I set a deadline for it. I set up how the committee was organized and how it should run according to the rules and regulations. I was also able to insert an amendment allowing the committee to change or add to the Charter and Bylaws as needed.  I am great at organizing and bringing people together. I am great at following rules and policy and also assisting others when they have misunderstandings bringing them together to resolve their issues. I am great at working in Teams, and I am also self-motivated to work independently. There is nothing like getting into the zone of getting the job done. I love to work with databases because that allows me to organize and make the work more efficient and productive. I often use or set the SMART goal model.</h2>
